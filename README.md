### Hi there, I'm Maxime 👋

Backend Engineer with a strong product mindset. I bridge the gap between complex systems and tangible business value. I am driven by high-performance engineering cultures and ambitious distributed systems challenges.

**Lead Backend Engineer at Chargemap**, I oversee the B2C web platform architecture. My role focuses on delivering high-availability APIs, covering core features like real-time charging status delivery (WebSockets), scalable user account management, and high-volume community feedback systems. A key part of my mission involves modernizing a mature codebase (legacy modernization) while maintaining high reliability.

🔧 **ENGINEERING RIGOR** I don't just write code; I build maintainable systems. I care about observability, clean architecture, and technical debt management.

💡 **FOUNDER DNA** As the founder of [HITLINE](https://www.hitline.fr), I understand that great tech must serve the product. I own my projects from conception to production.

📚 **CONTINUOUS LEARNER** Always pushing for the next level of performance—currently deep-diving into **Go** and high-concurrency patterns to broaden my technical toolkit.
